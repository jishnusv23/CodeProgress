## REACT
React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook
 (now Meta) and a community of individual developers and companies. Here are some key points about React:

1. Component-based: React uses a component-based architecture, allowing developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
2. Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual Document Object Model (DOM) to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.
3. JSX: React introduces JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
4. Unidirectional data flow: React implements a one-way data flow, making it easier to understand how data changes affect the application.
- A stateful component is a component that holds and manages its own state.
