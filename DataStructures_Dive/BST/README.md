# Binary Search Tree

- Value of the left node must be smaller than the parent
- Value of the right node must be greater than the parent
- No Duplicates Elements

## Operation

- insertion
- deletion
- search
- DFS [depth first search]
- BFS [breadth first search]

# Use of BST

- Searching
- Sorting
- To Implement abstract data types such as lookup and priority queues

## Applications of Binary Search Tree

- To store and retrive data in efficently from database
- symbol table
- Dictionary implemenation
- Auto complete and spell check
- Data Compression

# Depth-First-Search (DFS)

- DFS explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.focusing on depth

## Types of DFS
- Inorder (Left → Root → Right)
- Preorder (Root → Left → Right)
- Postorder (Left → Right → Root)
