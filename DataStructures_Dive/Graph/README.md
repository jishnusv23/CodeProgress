# A graph is a fundamental data structure in computer science that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) connected by a set of edges (or lines). Graphs are used to model relationships and connections between objects or entities.

## The key properties of a graph are:

- Vertices (nodes): The individual elements or objects represented in the graph.
- Edges (lines): The connections or relationships between the vertices.
- Adjacency: Two vertices are considered adjacent if they are connected by an edge.

## Graphs can be either directed or undirected:

- In a directed graph, the edges have a direction, representing a one-way relationship between the vertices.
- In an undirected graph, the edges have no direction, representing a mutual relationship between the vertices.

## Graphs have many applications, including:

- Modeling social networks
- Representing transportation networks
- Describing the flow of data in computer networks
- Organizing hierarchical data structures
- And many other domains where relationships between entities need to be represented.
