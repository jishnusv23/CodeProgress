# Trie Data Structure----------------------------------------------------------

# What is a Trie data structure?
## The word "Trie" is an excerpt from the word "retrieval". Trie is a sorted tree-based data-structure that stores the set of strings. It has the number of pointers equal to the   number of characters of the alphabet in each node. It can search a word in the dictionary with the help of the word's prefix. For example, if we assume that all strings are formed from the letters 'a' to 'z' in the English alphabet, each trie node can have a maximum of 26 points.# Trie Data Structure

## What is a Trie data structure?
The word "Trie" comes from the word "retrieval." A Trie is a sorted, tree-based data structure that stores a set of strings. Each node in a Trie has pointers equal to the number of characters in the alphabet. It efficiently enables searching words in a dictionary by utilizing the prefix of each word.

For example, if all strings consist of letters from 'a' to 'z' in the English alphabet, each Trie node can have up to 26 pointers.

### Key Features:
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Quickly searches words by their prefixes.
- **Memory Optimization**: Suitable for storing dictionaries of words.
