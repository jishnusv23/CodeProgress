## Functions

## 1. Regular Functions

- Are the most basic and common type of function in JavaScript
- Defined using the `function` keyword
- Have their own `this` binding
- Can be used as constructors

## 2. Arrow Functions

- Shorter syntax for writing functions
- Single line = automatic return
- They inherit `this` from parent scope
- Best for callbacks and simple operations

## 3. IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

- Used when you need private variables/functions
- Helps avoid naming conflicts
- Perfect for initialization code that runs only once
- Creates a new scope to protect variables

## 4.Callback Function

- They are used to heavily async programs
- Help in handling events and user actions
- Common array method (map,filter ,reduce)

## 5.Recursive Fucntion

- Always have based condition (stop condition)
- Each recursive call should move towards the base case
- Be careful with stack overflow
- Tree travesal,Complex data structure operation

## Generator Functions

- is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed
- Uses yield to push execution
- Use-Cases:Creating unique ID,Handling Large Dataset,Memory effcient data processing
